## Week 5: Calculator App

In this project, we're going to be building a fully responsive calculator app.

### Lesson 1: HTML Layout  
We begin the project by creating the basic structure of the calculator using HTML.

### Lesson 2: Event Handler  
We set up event handlers to detect when any calculator button is pressed.

### Lesson 3: Removing the Zero in the Display  
We add logic to remove the default zero from the display when the user starts entering numbers.

### Lesson 4: AC Button Event Handler  
We implement the event handler for the AC (All Clear) button, which clears the calculator's input area.

5. **Lesson 5: Operator Button Event Handler**  
We create event handlers for the operator buttons (+, −, ×, ÷), allowing users to perform calculations.

6. **Lesson 6: Equals Button Event Handler**  
We finalize the calculator logic by adding an event handler for the equals button, enabling calculation execution.

7. **Lesson 7: Styling**  
With the JavaScript functionality complete, we enhance the appearance of the calculator with CSS styling.
