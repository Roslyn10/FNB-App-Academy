## Calaculator App

1. **Lesson 1: HTML Layout** 
    We begin the project by creating the basic structure of the calculator using HTML.

2. **Lesson 2: Event Handler**  
    We set up event handlers to detect when any calculator button is pressed.

    We add logic to remove the default zero from the display when the user starts entering numbers.

4. **Lesson 4: AC Button Event Handler**  
    We implement the event handler for the AC (All Clear) button, which clears the calculator's input area.

5. **Lesson 5: Operator Button Event Handler**
    We create event handlers for the operator buttons (+, −, ×, ÷), allowing users to perform calculations.

6. **Lesson 6: Equals Button Event Handler**
    We finalize the calculator logic by adding an event handler for the equals button, enabling calculation execution.

    With the JavaScript functionality complete, we enhance the appearance of the calculator with CSS styling.
