# Week 4 – FNB App Academy
--------------------------

This week introduces JavaScript — the programming language that brings interactivity to web pages. You’ll learn the fundamentals of how it works and how to use it to control web content.

---

### Lesson 1: JavaScript Outputs

---

### Lesson 3: Variables Part 2  
*Explore using variables to store and calculate numerical values.*

---

### Lesson 4: Conditionals  
*Learn how to use `if` and `else` statements to make decisions in your code.*

---

### Lesson 5: Functions  
*Get introduced to functions, which let you group and reuse blocks of code.*

---

### Lesson 6: Functions Continued  
*Build on your knowledge by combining functions with conditional logic.*

---

### Lesson 7: Function Parameters  
*Discover how to pass information into functions using parameters.*

---

### Lesson 8: Function Return  
*Learn how functions can return values to be used elsewhere in your code.*

---

### Lesson 9: Variable Scope  
*Understand where variables are accessible and how scope affects your code.*

---

### Lesson 10: Mini Project – Login Form Part 1  
*Begin creating a basic login form and capturing user input with JavaScript.*

---

### Lesson 12: The `switch` Statement  
*Use `switch` statements as an alternative to long `if`/`else` chains.*

---

### Lesson 13: Numbers and Strings Part 1  
*Learn the difference between numbers and strings and how JavaScript treats them.*

---

### Lesson 14: Numbers and Strings Part 2 – Converting Text to Numbers
