# FNB App Academy: 9-Week Learning Journey
--------------------------------------------

Welcome to the FNB App Academy! Over the past 9 weeks, I've built a strong foundation in web development and Python programming through hands-on projects and structured lessons. Here's a high-level overview of everything I’ve accomplished.
