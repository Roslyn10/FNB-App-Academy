## Python Basics Pt.2

## Section1: Working with Lists

1. **Lesson 1: Lists Part 1**
    *Learn about lists, Pythonâ€™s ordered and changeable collection type. Access items using indexes, update elements, and print specific values.

2. **Lesson 2: Lists Part 2**
    Add items to a list using append() and insert(). Remove items with remove(), and sort lists in ascending or descending order using sort() and sort(reverse=True).

3. **Lesson 3: Tuples**
    Understand tuples as ordered, unchangeable collections. Access elements using indexes, concatenate two tuples, and repeat tuples with the * operator.

4. **Lesson 4: Sets**
    Explore sets, an unordered collection of unique values. Use add() and remove() to modify sets. Perform operations such as union(), intersection(), and difference() to compare sets.

5. **Lesson 5: Dictionaries**
    Learn how dictionaries store data as key-value pairs. Access values using keys, add new key-value pairs, and update existing ones.

6. **Lesson 6: Dictionaries Part 2**
    Although no new code was introduced in this lesson, we suggest extending the learning by:
        * Using del to remove items
        * Iterating through dictionaries with .items()
        * Checking if keys exist with in
        * Getting values safely with .get()

## Section 2: Shopping Cart

1. **Lesson 7: Creating a Shopping Cart**
    In this lesson, we build a simple command-line shopping cart app using Python. Users can enter food items and their prices, which are stored in two separate lists. The app allows continuous input until the user types 'q' to quit. It then calculates the total cost and displays a summary of all items added to the cart along with the final total price.
