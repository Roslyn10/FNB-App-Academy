## Html Basics

## Section 1: Getting Started with HTML

1. **Lesson 1: Introduction to HTML**  
   *What HTML is, why HTML5 is the current standard, and its key benefits (multimedia support, human‑readability, mobile optimization, cross‑platform apps).*

2. **Lesson 2: Setting Up a Workspace**  
   *Installing VS Code (Windows/macOS), organizing your project folder, and creating a basic HTML boilerplate (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).*

3. **Lesson 3: Creating Paragraphs**  
   *Using the `<p>` tag to add blocks of text, observing default browser spacing, and writing multiple paragraphs.*

4. **Lesson 4: Working with Headings**  
   *Structuring content with `<h1>` through `<h6>` tags—understanding hierarchy and the importance of logical nesting for accessibility and SEO.*

5. **Lesson 5: Web File Formats**  
   *Recognizing common extensions: `.html`/`.htm` for markup, `.css` for stylesheets, and image types (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`).*

## Section 2: Working with Images

1. **Lesson 1: Creating a Folder for Your Images**  
   *Setting up an `images/` directory to keep all picture assets organized in one place.*

2. **Lesson 2: Adding an Image**  
   *Embedding an image with `<img src="images/boat.jpg" />`, specifying correct filenames (case‑sensitive) and using meaningful `alt` text for accessibility.*

3. **Lesson 3: Resizing an Image**  
   *Controlling display size via `width` and `height` attributes on the `<img>` tag, defined in pixels.*

4. **Lesson 4: Adding More Images**  
   *Adding multiple `<img>` tags to build a simple gallery, and discussing when to use semantic `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for richer markup.*

## Section 3: Hyperlinks

1. **Lesson 1: Your First Hyperlink**  
   *Creating clickable text links using `<a href="http://www.example.com">Link text</a>` to navigate to external websites.*

2. **Lesson 2: Adding a Second Page**  
   *Creating a new HTML file (e.g., `about.html`) with headings and paragraphs to expand your site’s structure.*

3. **Lesson 3: Linking to the Second Page**  
   *Implementing internal navigation between `index.html` and `about.html` using relative URLs.*

4. **Lesson 4: A Page with an Image**  
   *Building `boat.html` to display a full‑size image and adding a link back to the homepage.*

5. **Lesson 5: Image Links**  
   *Nesting an `<img>` tag inside an `<a>` tag (e.g., `<a href="boat.html"><img src="images/boat.jpg" height="150"/></a>`) to make images themselves clickable.*
