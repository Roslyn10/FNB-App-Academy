# Week 7 - FNB App Academy
--------------------------

## Python Basics

1. **Lesson 1: Setting Up**
    We begin by installing Python and setting up the environment needed to run our code.

2. **Lesson 2: Strings**
    We learn how to create and display strings using single, double, and triple quotes.

3. **Lesson 3: Strings Part 2**
    We explore advanced string techniques like indexing, slicing, stripping whitespace, changing case, splitting strings, and replacing words.

4. **Lesson 4: Numeric Data**
    We introduce numeric data types such as integers and floats, and use the type() function to check them.

5. **Lesson 5: Variables**
    We cover how to declare and use variables, including best practices for naming them correctly.

6. **Lesson 6: Operators on Numeric Data***
    We perform arithmetic operations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.

7. **Lesson 7: Operators on Strings**
    We learn how to manipulate strings using operators, including concatenation and repetition.

8. **Lesson 8: Control Statements**
    We implement conditional logic with if and else statements to make decisions in our code.

9. **Lesson 9: Control Statements Part 2**
    We expand on control flow using if, elif, and else statements and compare user input values.

10. **Lesson 10: Loops**
    We begin working with loops using for loops and while loops to repeat code over lists and conditions.

11. **Lesson 11: Loops Part 2**
    We explore break, continue, and pass to control how loops behave during execution.

#12. **Lesson 12: Loop Control with While and For Loops**
    We combine loops with control statements to create more advanced flow logic using break, continue, and pass in both for and while loops.
