## Week 7 - FNB App Academy

In this project, we're learning the core fundamentals of Python programming, including working with strings, numbers, variables, operators, control statements, and loops.

### Lesson 1: Setting Up
We begin by installing Python and setting up the environment needed to run our code.

### Lesson 2: Strings
We learn how to create and display strings using single, double, and triple quotes.

### Lesson 3: Strings Part 2
We explore advanced string techniques like indexing, slicing, stripping whitespace, changing case, splitting strings, and replacing words.

### Lesson 4: Numeric Data
We introduce numeric data types such as integers and floats, and use the type() function to check them.

### Lesson 5: Variables
We cover how to declare and use variables, including best practices for naming them correctly.

### Lesson 6: Operators on Numeric Data
We perform arithmetic operations using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation.

### Lesson 7: Operators on Strings
We learn how to manipulate strings using operators, including concatenation and repetition.

### Lesson 8: Control Statements
We implement conditional logic with if and else statements to make decisions in our code.

### Lesson 9: Control Statements Part 2
We expand on control flow using if, elif, and else statements and compare user input values.

### Lesson 10: Loops
We begin working with loops using for loops and while loops to repeat code over lists and conditions.

### Lesson 11: Loops Part 2
We explore break, continue, and pass to control how loops behave during execution.

### Lesson 12: Loop Control with While and For Loops
We combine loops with control statements to create more advanced flow logic using break, continue, and pass in both for and while loops.
