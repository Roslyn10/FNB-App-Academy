## Python Functions, Modules & Exception Handling

## Section 1: Functions and Modules

1. **Lesson 1: Writing Functions**
    Learn how to define reusable blocks of code using def. Practice creating simple functions like greet() and add() to understand function structure, parameters, and return values. You also explore recursion by building a factorial() function.

2. **Lesson 2: Modules**
    Understand what modules are and how to organize your code into separate Python files. You create your own module (math_operations.py) containing custom functions like add() and sub().

3. **Lesson 3: Importing Modules**
    Learn how to import built-in and custom modules using import. Explore useful built-in modules like math, random, datetime, os, and sys, and use their functions to perform tasks like generating random numbers and retrieving the current date and time.

4. **Lesson 4: Rectangle Area and Perimeter Calculator**
    Build a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. This lesson reinforces how to structure your code using imported custom modules (calculate.py) and pass arguments to functions for computation.

## Section 2: Exception Handling

1. **Lesson 1: Exception Handling Part 1**
    Learn how to handle errors in your code using try, except, and finally blocks. Practice catching general exceptions and understanding how the program continues after handling errors.

2. **Lesson 2: Exception Handling Part 2**
    Explore more advanced exception handling by using specific exceptions like NameError, adding an else block for when no error occurs, and learning how to manually raise exceptions using the raise keyword.
